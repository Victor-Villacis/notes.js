# notes.js

A node app/file that allows you to take notes/thoughts on the command line from any directory.

1. Cd into ~ and or clone into your user home directory.
2. `chmod +x notes.js `to make it executable, if necessary.
3. Run `~/notes.js` from any directory, fill out prompts and node will create a notes.txt file
   in the same directory you ran the file.
